# Sprint C - A Possible (Partial) Resolution

This partial resolution of Sprint C is provided to serve as:

* Complementary feedback to the one received during the Sprint C evaluation on lab classes;
* An additional study material, reinforcing all the examples and explanations provided during classes and available on slides.


Other alternatives solutions/approaches might be acceptable, but many others might be wrong/incorrect in light of the principles lectured in ESOFT. In case of doubt, contact a faculty member.
