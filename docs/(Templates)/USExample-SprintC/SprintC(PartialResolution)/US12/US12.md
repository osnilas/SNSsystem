**Remark 1:** In this SD, methods' returns are explicitly represented by returning messages. No special reason  exists for this: it was just an option to provide some kind of UML diversity.

**Remark 2:** The "_SD_GET_EMPLOYEE_OF_CURRENT_USER_" is provide on US 4 folder

**Remark 3:** Since all domain objects are being kept/persisted just in memory, message 33 is not required/mandatory. However, in other persistence scenarios, that message might be necessary.

**Remark 4:** This proposed solution is in line with the one discussed in the TP classes.
