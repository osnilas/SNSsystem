# US 008 - to record the administration of a vaccine to a SNS user

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

*As an administrator, I want to load a set of users from a CSV file*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From Project Description document**

> After giving the vaccine to the user, each nurse registers the event in the system,
more precisely, registers the vaccine type (e.g.: Covid-19), vaccine name/brand (e.g.: Astra Zeneca,
Moderna, Pfizer), and the lot number used. Afterwards, the nurse sends the user to a recovery room,
to stay there for a given recovery period (e.g.: 30 minutes). If there are no problems, after the given
recovery period, the user should leave the vaccination center. The system should be able to notify
(e.g.: SMS or email) the user that his/her recovery period has ended. If the nurse identifies any
adverse reactions during that recovery period, the nurse should record the adverse reactions in the
system.

 

**From Client Forum - Requirements Clarification**

>- **Question:**
    -the CSV file only contains information about SNS users of if the CSV file may also contain some information about employees from that vaccination center.
>- **Answer:** The CSV file only contains information about SNS users




### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

**AC01-** the lot number has five alphanumeric characters an hyphen and two numerical characters./
### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

*Identify here any found out dependency to other US and/or requirements.*

- No dependencies were found

### 1.5 Input and Output Data
**Input Data:**\
**- Typed data:**
- SNS user number
- 

**- Selected data:**

- Vaccination facilities
- Vaccines
- SNS user information

**Output Data:**

- Saved list of SNS users
- (In)Success of the operation

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

There are some similarities to US 9 regarding the need to validate similar data, for exemple address and phone number. Thus needing to use the Validate class with methods to validate such data 
.
## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 

![US014-CD](US014_DM.svg) 

### 2.2. Other Remarks

-Similar feature, only difference is in this case the user doesn't type the data of the SNS user on the console.\
-There are some similarities to US 3 and US 10 regarding the need to generate a password.

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:
 * SNS user

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * AddSNSfromCSVUI  
 * AddSNSfromCSVController
 * SNSuserDTO 
 * MapperSNSuser
 * Company
 * Utils

Other software classes of external systems/components:
 * AuthFacade
