# US 008 - to record the administration of a vaccine to a SNS user

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

*As a nurse, I want to record the administration of vaccine to a SNS user.*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From Project Description document**

> At any time, a nurse responsible for administering the vaccine will use the application **to check the
list of SNS users that are present in the vaccination center** to take the vaccine and will call one SNS
user to administer him/her the vaccine. Usually, the **user that has arrived firstly will be the first one**
to be vaccinated (like a FIFO queue). However, sometimes, due to operational issues, that might not
happen. The **nurse checks the user info and health conditions in the system and in accordance with
the scheduled vaccine type, and the SNS user vaccination history**, (s)he **gets system instructions
regarding the vaccine to be administered (e.g.: vaccine and respective dosage considering the SNS
user age group)**. After giving the vaccine to the user, each nurse registers the event in the system,
more precisely, **registers the vaccine type (e.g.: Covid-19), vaccine name/brand (e.g.: Astra Zeneca,
Moderna, Pfizer), and the lot number used**. Afterwards, the **nurse sends the user to a recovery room,
to stay there for a given recovery period** (e.g.: 30 minutes). If there are no problems, after the given
recovery period, the user should leave the vaccination center. The **system should be able to notify
(e.g.: SMS or email) the user that his/her recovery period has ended**.

 

**From Client Forum - Requirements Clarification**

>- **Question:**
    -the CSV file only contains information about SNS users of if the CSV file may also contain some information about employees from that vaccination center.
>- **Answer:** The CSV file only contains information about SNS users

>- **Question:**
    -In US 08 says: "At the end of the recovery period, the user should receive a SMS message informing the SNS user that he can leave the vaccination center." How should the SNS user receive and have access to the SMS message?
>- **Answer:** A file named SMS.txt should be used to receive/record the SMS messages. We will not use a real word service to send SMSs.

>- **Question:**
    -Previously the client answered that: \
    1. The nurse selects a SNS user from a list.\
    2. Checks user's Name, Age and Adverse Reactions registered in the system.\
    However, our group has five members and the US07: Register an adverse reaction is not obligatory to be implemented. So, with this in mind we would like to know if we, in step 2, should only show the Name and the Age or other information.
>- **Answer:** If your team does not implement US7, then you should show a message saying "No Adverse Reactions registered in the system".

>- **Question:**
    -I would like some clarification on the following points:\
    1. Is the nurse responsible for registering in the system the recovery period?\
    2. If there are no adverse reactions detected/registered, after the given recovery period, the system notifies the user that his/her recovery period has ended, right?\
    3. If there are adverse reactions detected/registered, the system should not do anything additional?\
>- **Answer:** \
   1- No. The recovery period starts automatically after registering the administration of a given vaccine.\
   2 and 3- US7 and US 8 are independent user stories.

>- **Question:**
    -As we can read in Project Description, the vaccination flow follows these steps:\
    1. Nurse calls one user that is waiting in the waiting room to be vaccinated;\
    2. Nurse checks the user's health data as well as which vaccine to administer;\
    3. Nurse administers the vaccine and registers its information in the system.\
    The doubt is: do you want US08 to cover steps 2 and 3, or just step 3?
>- **Answer:**\
  1-The nurse selects a SNS user from a list.\
  2-Checks user's Name, Age and Adverse Reactions registered in the system.\
  3-Registers information about the administered vaccine.

>- **Question:**
    -I would like to know some clarifications about the following points:\
    1- The system displays the list of possible vaccines to be administered (considering the age group of the user); then the nurse selects the dose she is going to administer and gets information about the dosage. But wouldn't it be more correct, since the system knows the vaccination history, in other words, if the user has already take x dose(s) of that vaccine, to simply show the dose and the respective dosage and not ask for the nurse to arbitrarily select it?\
    2- After giving the vaccine to the user, how should the nurse register the vaccine type? by the code?
>- **Answer:**\
   1- If it is the first dose, the application should show the list of possible vaccines to be administered. If is is not a single dose vaccine, when the SNS user arrives to take the vaccine, the system should simply show the dose and the respective dosage.\
   2- A vaccine is associated with a given vaccine type. Therefore, there is no need to register the vaccine type.\
   Moreover, the nurse should also register the vaccine lot number (the lot number has five alphanumeric characters an hyphen and two numerical characters (example: 21C16-05)).

>- **Question:**
    -Supposing that the SNS user has already received a dose of a given vaccine type (for example, COVID-19), the user can only receive the same vaccine or a different one with the same vaccine type?
>- **Answer:**
   -The SNS user can only receive the same vaccine.\
   Related information:\
   A SNS user is fully vaccinated when he receives all doses of a given vaccine.\
   A SNS user that has received a single-dose vaccine is considered fully vaccinated and will not take more doses.\
   A SNS user that is fully vaccinated will not be able to schedule a new vaccine of the type for which he is already fully vaccinated.

>- **Question:**
    -To access the user info - scheduled vaccine type and vaccination history -, should the nurse enter user's SNS number?
>- **Answer:**
    -The nurse should select a SNS user from a list of users that are in the center to take the vaccine.
### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

**AC01-** the lot number has five alphanumeric characters an hyphen and two numerical characters./
### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

*Identify here any found out dependency to other US and/or requirements.*

- US01 and US02 as they are the requirements for this US, the SNS user having an appoiment.
- US03 and US14 as they register a SNS user.
- US12 and US13 as they register an vaccine.
- US04 and US08 as they register an SNS user arrival and add them to the waiting list.
### 1.5 Input and Output Data
**Input Data:**\
**- Typed data:**
