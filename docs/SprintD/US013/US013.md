# US 013 - To specify a new vaccine and its administrative process

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as
well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and
existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identify the involved input and output data and depicted an
Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*

### 1.1. User Story Description

As an administrator, I intendo to specify a new vaccine and its adminintration process.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**
> [...] for each type of vaccine, several vaccines might exist, each one
> demanding a distinct administration process. For instance, for the Covid-19 type, there is (i) the
> Pfizer vaccine, (ii) the Moderna vaccine, (iii) the Astra Zeneca vaccine, and so on.

> The vaccine administration process comprises (i) one or more age groups (e.g.: 5 to 12 years old, 13 to 18 years
> old, greater than 18 years old), and (ii) per age group, the doses to be administered (e.g.: 1, 2, 3), the
> vaccine dosage (e.g.: 30 ml), and the time interval regarding the previously administered dose.

**From the client calrifications:**
> - **Question:** Regarding the US13 (Specify a new vaccine and its administration process) is there more data that
    should be inserted besides the number of doses of the vaccine and the necessary time between doses?
>
> - **Answer:** *Not yet provided*

> - **Question:** As to the interval between doses, what time format are we to use? (e.g. days, weeks, months)
>
> - **Answer:** Number of days.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

**Omitted/ Not Provided.**

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

This US depends on US012 since a vaccine type needs to be already in the system in order to be given an administrative
process.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Typed Data:**
    - vaccine brand
    - age group/ range
    - dosage
    - doses
    - interval between doses

- **Output Data:**
    - (In)Success of the operation

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

*Use this section to capture other relevant information that is related with this US such as (i) special requirements
; (ii) data and/or technology variations; (iii) how often this US is held.*

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* VaccineAdministration
* Company


Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* VaccineAdministrationUI (applying the "pure fabrication" pattern)
* VaccineAdministrationController (applying the "controller"pattern)
