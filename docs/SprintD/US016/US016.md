# US16 - To analiyze the performance of a center

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

As a center coordinator, I intend to analiyze the performance of a center.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

- "Now, the problem consists in determining what the contiguous subsequence of the initial sequence
  is, whose sum of their entries is maximum. This will show the time interval, in such a day, when the
  vaccination center was less effective in responding. So, the application should implement a bruteforce algorithm (an algorithm which examines all the contiguous subsequences) to determine the
  contiguous subsequence with maximum sum.
  
- "The Center Coordinator wants to monitor the vaccination process, to see
  statistics and charts, to evaluate the performance of the vaccination process, generate reports and
  analyze data from other centers, including data from legacy systems. The goal of the performance
  analysis is to decrease the number of clients in the center, from the moment they register at the
  arrival, until the moment they receive the SMS informing they can leave the vaccination center."

**From the client clarifications:**

> - **Question:**
    "Is the time of departure of an SNS user the time he got vaccinated plus the recovery time or do we have another way of knowing it?"
>
> - **Answer:** "The time of departure of an SNS user is the time he got vaccinated plus the recovery time."


> - **Question:**
    "I would like to know if we could strict the user to pick only those intervals (m) (i.e. 1, 5, 10, 20, 30) as options for analyzing the performance of a center, since picking intervals is dependent on the list which is 720/m (which the length is an integer result). If we let the user pick an interval that results in a non-integer result, this will result in an invalid list since some data for the performance analysis will be lost. Can you provide a clarification on this situation? "
>
> - **Answer:** "The user can introduce any interval value. The system should validate the interval value introduced by the user."


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies


* Dependency with US17 since US17 imports data from a legacy sistem that is used to calculate the performance of a center


### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**

* **Typed data:**
    * Day of the performance analysis
    * Time interval

* **Selected data:**
    * (none)


**Output Data:**

* (In)Success of the operation

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

* There are some similarities to US 7 regarding the need (i) to generate a password and (ii) to send an email to the resulting user.

# 4. Tests

**Omitted**

# 5. Construction (Implementation)


**Omitted**


# 6. Integration and Demo

* A new option to the receptionist menu was added.

# 7. Observations

As requested by the SW Client the e-mail are not being sent. Instead, email are being written to a file with the name emailAndSMSMessages.txt.

Further, after SW Client deciding which Email Service to use, it will be necessary to update the class __EmailNotificationSender__.
