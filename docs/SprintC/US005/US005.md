# US005 - Consult the users in the waiting room of a vacination center.

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identify the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*


### 1.1. User Story Description

As a nurse, I intend to consult the users in the waiting room of a vacination center.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

> **Question**: "Regarding US 05, what does consulting constitute in this context? Does it refer only to seeing who is present and deciding who gets the vaccine or is checking the user info to administer the vaccine, registering the process, and sending it to the recovery room also part of this US?"
>
> **Answer**: The goal is to check the list of users that are waiting and ready to take the vaccine.

> **Question**: "I would like to know which are the attributes of the waiting room."
> 
> **Answer**: The waiting room will not be registered or defined in the system. The waiting room of each vaccination center has the capacity to receive all users who take the vaccine on given slot.

> **Question**: "We need to know if the nurse have to chose the vaccination center before executing the list or if that information comes from employee file?"
>
> **Answer**: When the nurse starts to use the application, firstly, the nurse should select the vaccination center where she his working. The nurse wants to check the list of SNS users that are waiting in the vaccination center where she his working.

> **Question**: "What information about the Users (name, SNS number, etc) should the system display when listing them?"
> 
> **Answer**: Name, Sex, Birth Date, SNS User Number and Phone Number.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* SNS Usersâ€™ list should be presented by order of arrival.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* There is a dependency to "US004 Register the arrival of a SNS user
  to take the vaccine" since the registration of their arrival must be done beforehand consulting the waiting room.
* There is a dependency to "US009 Register a vaccination center to respond to a certain
  pandemic" since there must be registered vaccination centers in order to consult the waiting room from
### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input data:**

* Typed data:
  * None
* Selected data:
  * Operation selected (consulting the waiting room)


**Output data:**

* List of users in the waiting room
* Sucess or insucess of the operation

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Class1
* Class2
* Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:
* ConsultWaitingRoomUI
* ConsultWaitingRoomController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

![USXXX-SD](USXXX-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

# 4. Tests
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.*

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 6. Integration and Demo

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
