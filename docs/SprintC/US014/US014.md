# US 014 - to load a set of users from a CSV file

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

*As an administrator, I want to load a set of users from a CSV file*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

*Insert here any related specification and/or clarification provided by the client together with **your interpretation**. When possible, provide a link to such specifications/clarifications.*

**From Project Description document**

**From Client Forum - Requirements Clarification**

>- **Question:**
    -the CSV file only contains information about SNS users of if the CSV file may also contain some information about employees from that vaccination center.
>- **Answer:** The CSV file only contains information about SNS users

>- **Question:**
   -When the admin wants to upload a CSV file to be read, should the file be stored at a specific location on the computer (e.g. the desktop) or should the admin be able to choose the file he wants to upload in a file explorer?"
>- **Answer:** The Administrator should write the file path.

>- **Question:**
   -What would be the sequence of parameters to be read on the CSV?
>- **Answer**  Name, Sex, Birth Date, Address, Phone Number, E-mail, SNS User Number and Citizen Card Number.

>- **Question**
    Also I would like to ask if there is any restrictions to the client age and what is the format of the Birth Date and the length of the phone number, citizen card number, and the SNS User number."
>-**Answer** > 
>- The dates registered in the system should follow the Portuguese format (dd/mm/yyyy). Regarding the other attributes, please study the concepts and define appropriate formats for the attributes.

>- **Question**
-Can the SNS User change the password?
>- **Answer** No. 

>- **Question**
-Should the new SNS User receive a message/notification that the registry got successfully completed?\
>**Answer** 
-Yes.



### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

**AC01-** Each user must have a single role defined in the system.\
**AC02-** Phone number must have 9 digits\
**AC03-** CC number must have 8 digits\
**AC04-** SNS number must have 9 digits\
**AC05-** Sex is the only optional atribute\
**AC06-** The application must support importing two types of CSV
files:\
a) one type must have a header, column separation is done using “;”
character;\
b) the other type does not have a header, column separation is done
using “,” character.\
**AC07-** The E-mail, Phone Number, Citizen Card Number and SNS User Number should be unique for each SNS user.\
**AC08-** The SNS user must become a system user. The "auth"
component available on the repository must be reused (without modifications)\
**AC09-** The password should be randomly generated. It should have 7 alphanumeric characters, including three capital letters and two digits.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

*Identify here any found out dependency to other US and/or requirements.*

**US3: As a receptionist, I want to register a SNS user**

-Similar feature, only difference is in this case the user doesn't type the data on the console.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data
**Input Data:**\
**- Typed data:**
- name
- sex
- birthdate
- email
- address
- citizen card number
- SNS user Number
- phone number

**- Selected data:**

- SNS user role for login credentials 

**Output Data:**

- Saved list of SNS users
- (In)Success of the operation

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

There are some similarities to US 9 regarding the need to validate similar data, for exemple address and phone number. Thus needing to use the Validate class with methods to validate such data 
.
## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.*

### 2.2. Other Remarks

-There are some similarities to US 3 and US 10 regarding the need to generate a password.
## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:
 * SNS user
 * Company?

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * AddSNSfromCSVUI  
 * AddSNSfromCSVController
 * SNSuserDTO 
 * MapperSNSuser

Other software classes of external systems/components:
 * AuthFacade

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* 

![US010-SD](US010_SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

## 7. Observations

As requested by the client, the password are not shown on the UI.
