## Usability


**Human Factor**

Speed, ease, and error-free processing are paramount in the operation of an application, as the SNS user wishes 
to leave quickly, or they perceive the vaccination process (and) as less positive. 
The same can be said of the experience of the nurse or receptionist as delays can cause larger problems in the vaccination process

    

## Reliability
_Refers to the integrity, compliance and interoperability of the software. The requirements to be considered are: frequency and severity of failure, possibility of recovery, possibility of prediction, accuracy, average time between failures._


(fill in here )

## Performance
_Evaluates the performance requirements of the software, namely: response time, start-up time, recovery time, memory consumption, CPU usage, load capacity and application availability._

## Supportability

_**Configurability**_

Different vaccination center will have different vaccines, vaccination capacities, number of personal and so on.
They desire the ability to modify these configurations, to reflect evolution of the vaccination process and performance needs. 
Therefore, the system will be somewhat configurable to reflect these needs.
